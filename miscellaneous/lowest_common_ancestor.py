Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
  Go to Discuss
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q 
as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given the following binary tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]


 

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
Example 2:

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA 
definition.
 

Note:

All of the nodes' values will be unique.
p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.


Complexity Analysis

    Time Complexity : O(N)O(N)O(N), where NNN is the number of nodes in the binary tree. In the worst case we might be visiting all the nodes of the binary tree. The advantage of this approach is that we can prune backtracking. We simply return once both the nodes are found.

    Space Complexity : O(N)O(N)O(N). In the worst case the space utilized by stack would be NNN since the height of a skewed binary tree could be NNN.
